      <h1>I'm Monica üòç</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Monica, and I am a passionate and curious individual with a strong interest in
         technology and creativity. I enjoy learning new things,
          especially in the fields of web development, programming, 
          and design. I'm currently exploring JavaScript and React to 
          build interactive user interfaces and real-world applications. 
          Outside of tech, I value meaningful connections, personal 
          growth, and finding joy in everyday moments. 
          I'm always eager to improve my skills, take on new challenges, 
          and bring ideas to life through code.
